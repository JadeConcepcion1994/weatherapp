I implemented this UI/UX design to make it easy for the tourist to use this web application. This design is plain and simple to avoid confusions and conflicts on the users end.


My code implementation for this application is well organized and documented. This app uses Laravel and Vue.js as its main core, it renders content fron the vue components and shows on
blade template. It uses JQUERY and AJAX (Javascript libraries) to request API response from https://foursquare.com/ and https://openweathermap.org/ it also uses bootstrap framework
for the front end design and responsiveness.





NOTE*
run composer install (to install autoloads)

if having error on routes, do this (this is how I did it in my localhost)
Setup your apache, to redirect the application to open on /public directory (it is where the index.php)
to avoid page 404 not found
